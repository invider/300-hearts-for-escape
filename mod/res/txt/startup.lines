Local doctor told you about the disease./ All villagers are infected!/ Buy 3 herbs in Central Town./ That might help you.
Get 3 herbs here/ and get back to Dareburg.
Doctor says:/ "Sorry, looks like herbs can't help.../ Nobody on this island can.../ Go to Port of Hope and get out of this island!"/
It is panic in the port./You find the captain./ He looks for heroes with 300 hearts/to get to the mainland and find/ the cure./ Find enough hearts to get on board!
